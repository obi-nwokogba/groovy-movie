## A little background
I am currently a Software Engineering student at General Assembly, and recently we were introduced to the world of connecting APIs, and one of my instructors told me about TheMovieDB.org's API, and after looking at it, it was a film lover's dream come true - having all that information on movies, series, actors, directors, the Box Office, new releases - all waiting to be presented in a meaningful way to the next person eager to push the 'PLAY' button on their remote control! As a fan of well-made movies, this is my effort to bring you closer to the big screen.


##### Discovering Quentin Tarantino via Pulp Fiction

It was after I watched 'Pulp Fiction' by Quentin Tarantino I suddenly was aware of the fact that there are some phenomenal directors in the world of film. It was the first screenplay I ever saw and read. I have always admired Quentin Tarantino, since he also writes the screenplays for every single on of his movies. This is a short dialogue from 'Inglourious Basterds', staring Brad Pitt, Diane Kruger, Michael Fassbender. This is a beautiful dialogue between two British military officials in the middle of World War 2, fighting the Hitler's Third Reich:

> **Lt. Archie Hicox** : Well, sir, such as they are, I write reviews and articles for a publication called 'Films & Filmmakers.' As well as our sister publication.

>**General Ed Fenech** : What's that called?

>**Lt. Archie Hicox** : 'Flickers Bi-Monthly', and I've had two books published.

>**General Ed Fenech** : Impressive. Don't be modest, Lieutenant. What are their titles?

>Lt. Archie Hicox : The first book was called 'Art of the Eyes, the Heart, and the Mind: A Study of German Cinema in the Twenties.' And the second one was called '<u>Twenty-Four Frame Da Vinci</u>.' It's a subtextual film criticism study of the work of German director G. W. Pabst.

>**Lt. Archie Hicox** : [he hands the General a whiskey]  What should we drink to, sir?
