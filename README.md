## A little background
I am currently a Software Engineering student at General Assembly, and recently we were introduced to the world of connecting APIs, and one of my instructors told me about TheMovieDB.org's API, and after looking at it, it was a film lover's dream come true - having all that information on movies, series, actors, directors, the Box Office, new releases - all waiting to be presented in a meaningful way to the next person eager to push the 'PLAY' button on their remote control! As a fan of well-made movies, this is my effort to bring you closer to the big screen.

## User Stories
- I want to be able to discover really good movies easily.
